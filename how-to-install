# Steps to create project

1 The first time you build the project, you must execute this command

    $ docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/$(basename `pwd`)" -w "/$(basename `pwd`)" -it node:latest sh -c "npm install -g @angular/cli && ng new angulartest --directory ."

2 Once the project already has a package.json file yo must execute this:
    $ docker-compose up --build -p 

3 Finally, check container status: 

    $ docker ps

4 Ready to go!
